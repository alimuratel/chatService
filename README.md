# chatService
Senior Software Developer Proje İçeriği Hk.
Project :
Chat Service
- chatService.sln
-server.cproj
-client.cproj
- A public github repository for the project from the start of the project (I would like to see all the
commit histories)
- Console c# application for the server
- Console c# application for the clients (should be tested with Minimum 2 clients )
- using only pure .Net asynchronous socket programming
- Unit tests are mandatory
- if one client try to send more than 1 message per second the chat server will warn the client and
if this happen again the chat server will close the chat client's connection
- well structure coding , commenting and usage of necessary design patterns are very important
